# Rocket-UP-

This is my first every Godot game after leaving Unity. There were pretty much 0 Godot C# tutorials and the docs are not as helpful as they seem, so pretty much everything had to be made through sheer luck with trial and error. I'd say that this project has helped me a lot in leanrning Godot. I should be able to make some better quality games than this. I made all the sprites myself (except the background), so I know they're shit. I'll try to do better pixel art or I can just yoink some free assets.
